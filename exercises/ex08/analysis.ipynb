    "\n",
    "After conducting a data analysis I have conluded that the data supports my idea to an extent. While there are still other questions that can be asked to the students to further prove this conclusion, there is enough evidence to give the idea a trial and error run. In the data analysis you can see that there are plenty of students in the class that have had some sort of coding or computer scinece experience. This proves that the stakeholders im looking at are there. On top of that you can see that the majority of the class are finding the class not very difficult and have a good understanding of the contents in the class. This proves that there is more the instructors can do to challenge these stakeholders, since they are finding the class fairly easy. I recommend that for each exercise the instuctor can post a different more challenging one that is optional to try, but if they try and succeed at it, this more challening exercise can take the place as the original exercise in the gradebook and they will not have to do the original exercise. The downsides of this idea is that it may cause the student to spend more time on each exercise that they normally would, if the student quits the harder exercise half-way through they would've wasted all that time, and the student may get a worse grade for trying to challenge themselves. Some extentions or refienments to my idea are there could be multiple levels of difficulty for the assignments(not just standard and hard), the challenging exercises shouldbe allowed for any student in the class who feels ready for it not just the ones with pervious experience, and these more difficult exercises should have student be allowed to work and discuss on them together."
